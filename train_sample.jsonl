{"title": "Muslim Women in Hijab Break Barriers: \u2018Take the Good With the Bad\u2019", "headline": "Even as reports of hate crimes against Muslims rise in America and Canada, hijabis are appearing in makeup ads, beauty pageants and news anchor chairs.", "abstract": "When Ginella Massa, a Toronto-based TV reporter, recently accepted a request to host an evening newscast, she was not planning or expecting to make history for wearing a hijab. She was just covering for a colleague who wanted to go to a hockey game. And that\u2019s how Ms. Massa, who works at CityNews in Toronto, became the first Canadian woman to host a newscast from a large media company while wearing the head scarf. Her newscast, broadcast on Nov. 17, became the subject of social media celebration, and news sites around the world heralded her. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little insane the last two weeks,\u201d Ms. Massa, 29, said in an interview. \u201cMy phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing. I\u2019m still working, so I\u2019m trying to field calls and messages and everything in between.\u201d Ms. Massa\u2019s newscast was one of a string of recent stories about young hijab-wearing women, or hijabis , who have pushed boundaries by strolling into spaces where the standards of appearance tend to be restrictive. Nura Afia, a 24-year-old from Colorado , was hired as a CoverGirl makeup ambassador. And Halima Aden, a 19-year-old from Minnesota, was a contestant in a beauty pageant. Ms. Aden sported a hijab and, during the swimwear portion of the competition, a burkini. \u201cAll my relatives in Somalia are like, \u2018We don\u2019t know what pageants are,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Aden told NPR , \u201c \u2018but congratulations.\u2019 \u201d This new trend of inclusion occurs amid a more sinister one, as reported hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise in the United States and Canada. The F.B.I. says that a surge in hate crimes against Muslims has led to an overall increase in hate crimes in the United States; Muslims have borne the brunt of the increase with 257 recorded attacks. A spike in bias attacks has been reported since the election of Donald J. Trump, with episodes ranging from an attack against a Muslim police officer in New York City to vandalism of a mosque in Massachusetts. (The crimes, which include anti-Semitic and racist attacks, are so frequent The Times is tracking them weekly.) In Canada, where Ms. Massa has lived since she was a year old, the number of reported hate crimes has dropped slightly overall, but the number of recorded attacks against Muslims has grown: 99 attacks were reported in 2014, according to an analysis by the news site Global News of data from Statistics Canada , a government agency. That number doubled from the 45 reported in 2012. On Twitter, Ms. Massa has been flooded with compliments for her work on CityNews, but with the good comes an influx of hateful messaging. \u201cThe more exposure I get,\u201d Ms. Massa said, \u201cthe more hate I get. Which I guess comes with the territory.\u201d She added: \u201cYou take the good with the bad.\u201d Her colleagues, who have also received hate mail , have spoken out publicly in Ms. Massa\u2019s defense. When it comes to her detractors, Ms. Massa has adopted the following credo: \u201cThat negative reaction comes from reading a headline and seeing a photo and deciding they don\u2019t like the way I look. That\u2019s not my problem. That\u2019s theirs.\u201d In that vein, high-profile instances of inclusion will continue. Companies are responding to a demand that is clear in commerce and expansive on social media: The Muslim cosmetics and care market is projected to reach $80 billion by 2020 . Last year, H&M hired a hijabi model who was discovered on Instagram. Elsewhere on the platform, an account featuring a hijab-wearing Barbie , Hijarbie, has more than 76,000 followers. A Muslim teenager has created a plan to bring hijabi emojis to phone keyboards everywhere. And Ms. Afia was discovered after amassing a following on YouTube.

Credit Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Covergirl Not everyone wants to see a woman in a head scarf represented in popular culture, and that even includes some Muslim women, who believe that a hijab represents only one side of a large and diverse religion. Even the word \u201chijab\u201d belies how complex the uses of the scarf can be: It\u2019s a catchall term for scarves that differ by type and trend. Not all Muslim women wear head coverings. Some believe the hijab is not a religious requirement, while others view it as a symbol of oppression . The reasons a woman chooses to wear a hijab can be highly personal, with some seeing modesty as its own form of empowerment . \u201cWe live in a strange society where walking around half naked is acceptable but being modest and covering up is frowned upon,\u201d a Canada-based reader named Safiya told The Times in 2015. Celene Ibrahim, a Muslim chaplain at Tufts University, said that these examples of Muslim women wearing the hijab were encouraging but that they also highlighted obstacles to come. In particular, the visible symbol suggests a uniformity in the Muslim community that is not accurate. The community looks very different \u201cdepending on who you ask,\u201d Ms. Ibrahim said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think that diversity is something that people are really struggling to get their minds around.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s also the sense that Muslims would just like to be able to participate in American culture without necessarily feeling the stigma of always having to represent Muslims.\u201d", "keyword": [["Muslim Veiling"], ["Hate crime"], ["Women and Girls"], ["Canada"], ["US"], ["Islam"], ["Fashion"], ["News media", "journalism"]], "file_name": "hijab-muslim-women", "date": "2016/12/08", "categories": ["world", "americas"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/americas/hijab-muslim-women.html", "author": "Katie Rogers"}
{"title": "For Donald Trump\u2019s Big Speech, an Added Pressure: No Echoes", "headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is said to have given orders that any language in his speech even loosely inspired by essays, books or Twitter posts must be rewritten or attributed.", "abstract": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Until Monday night, Donald J. Trump\u2019s biggest concern about his convention speech was how much to reveal about himself and his family in an address that is often the most personal one a presidential candidate delivers. But the political firestorm over his wife\u2019s speech , which borrowed passages from Michelle Obama\u2019s convention remarks in 2008, raised the stakes exponentially. Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Thursday night cannot merely be his best ever. It also has to be bulletproof. By Tuesday morning, word had spread throughout his campaign that any language in Mr. Trump\u2019s address even loosely inspired by speeches, essays, books or Twitter posts had to be either rewritten or attributed. Mr. Trump\u2019s chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, reassured colleagues that the acceptance speech was wholly original, according to two staff members who spoke with him and described those conversations on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Miller also told campaign aides that he had looked closely at passages that Mr. Trump had contributed \u2014 handwritten on unlined white pages \u2014 and was confident they contained no problems. (Mr. Miller declined an interview request.) Even so, one of the staff members downloaded plagiarism-detection software and ran a draft of the speech through the program. No red flags came up. The intense scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s words added new pressure to a speechwriting process that has been one of the most unpredictable and free-form in modern presidential campaigns. A month ago, Mr. Trump began giving dictation on themes for the speech, and he tossed ideas and phrases to Mr. Miller or other advisers on a daily basis. On printed copies of each draft, he circled passages he liked, crossed out or put question marks beside lines that he did not favor and frequently suggested new words or phrases. Image Stephen Miller, left, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief speechwriter, and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, before an event for the candidate at the Trump SoHo hotel in New York last month. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019ve been amending the drafts big-league,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview in his Manhattan office before the convention. \u201cI get ideas from a lot of different places, a lot of smart people, but mostly I like language that sounds like me.\u201d Yet in the aftermath of Melania Trump\u2019s speech, campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language \u2014 whether they are his own, in other words, or are picked up from Twitter, television, or, say, a best seller by Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News, a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes. Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism, but several Trump advisers, who also insisted on anonymity, said that after the furor over Ms. Trump\u2019s remarks, the campaign cannot allow a similar blowup. Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who is advising a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Trump, said that the candidate could not afford any mistakes. \u201cHis speech is the whole game,\u201d Mr. Rollins said. \u201cViewers have to watch it and say, \u2018There is the next president of the United States.\u2019\u201d In the interview, Mr. Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that \u201conce existed and no longer does, but can again under a Trump administration.\u201d Latest Election Polls 2016 Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. His greatest challenge, he said, was \u201cputting myself in the speech\u201d \u2014 discussing his upbringing and early experiences and relating them to the hopes and aspirations of other Americans. \u201cI was never comfortable getting personal about my family because I thought it was special territory,\u201d Mr. Trump said, glancing at a picture of his father on his desk. \u201cIt can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes. And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up. I had a great relationship with my father. But my focus needs to be on all the Americans who are struggling.\u201d He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred, who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43 \u2014 and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives that seem golden. \u201cWithout my brother Fred I might not be here,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe was really smart, great-looking. I don\u2019t drink or smoke because of what happened to him. I focused on building my business and making good choices. I may talk about that, but I don\u2019t know if I should.\u201d Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs: Mitt Romney, trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman, devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents\u2019 unconditional love, his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing. In 2008 , Barack Obama described how his grandfather benefited from the G.I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught him the value of hard work. And Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working hard, from his grandfather about racial equality \u2014 and from his wife, Hillary, who, Mr. Clinton said, taught him that every child could learn. Mr. Clinton finished his speech with a now-famous line tying his Arkansas hometown to the American dream. \u201cI end tonight where it all began for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe in a place called Hope.\u201d James Carville, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him as divisive or bigoted, he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech. \u201cIf he\u2019s really different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies, Thursday\u2019s speech will be his single greatest opportunity to show voters who he really is,\u201d Mr. Carville said. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said that Thursday\u2019s speech would be \u201cvery much a reflection of Mr. Trump\u2019s own words, as opposed to remarks that others create and the campaign puts in his mouth.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not an editor \u2014 he is actually the creator of the speech,\u201d Mr. Manafort said. \u201cMr. Trump has given Steve Miller and I very specific directions about how he views the speech, what he wants to communicate, and ways to tie together things that he has been talking about in the campaign. The speech will end up being tone-perfect because the speech\u2019s words will be his words.\u201d Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes, a style that has proved successful at his rallies, where he has shown a talent for connecting with and electrifying crowds. But his adjustment to formal speeches remains a work in progress: He does not always sound like himself, and reading from a text can detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize. One question is whether, or how much, he will ad-lib. He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared remarks, often to ill effect \u2014 ranting about a mosquito , or joking that a passing airplane was from Mexico and was \u201c getting ready to attack .\u201d \u201cAd-libbing is instinct, all instinct,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI thought maybe about doing a freewheeling speech for the convention, but that really wouldn\u2019t work. But even with a teleprompter, the speech will be me \u2014 my ideas, my beliefs, my words.\u201d", "keyword": [["2016 Presidential Election"], ["Donald Trump"], ["Republican National Convention", "RNC"], ["Speeches"], ["Plagiarism"], ["Melania Trump"]], "file_name": "donald-trump-speech", "date": "2016/07/21", "categories": ["us", "politics"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-speech.html", "author": "Patrick Healy", "id": "0282969"}
{"title": "In Home Opener, Rangers Lose Gaborik and Drury to Injuries", "headline": "The Maple Leafs won in overtime, and the Rangers\u2019 Marian Gaborik and Chris Drury had to leave with injuries.", "abstract": "There were silver linings to the Rangers \u2019 wild 4-3 overtime loss in their home opener at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. But the clouds they lined were huge, dark and ominous. Marian Gaborik left the game with a separated left shoulder in the second period after being boarded by Toronto\u2019s Colby Armstrong. Gaborik, whose 42 goals led the Rangers last season, will be out of action for at least two weeks, Rangers Coach John Tortorella said after the game. Chris Drury also left with an injury in the second period after colliding with his teammate Michal Rozsival and falling into the boards. Drury, making his season debut after missing the first two games with a broken left index finger, broke the same finger in a different place. He will be out six weeks, Tortorella said. Vinny Prospal, the Rangers\u2019 No. 2 scorer last season, will be operated on Tuesday to repair the right knee that has prevented him from playing so far this season. Tortorella said Prospal would be out indefinitely. The silver linings could be found in the Rangers\u2019 ability to rally from a 3-1 second-period deficit, as well as a 30-12 shooting deficit, to tie the Leafs at the end of regulation and salvage a point in the standings. The star of the game for the Rangers was Brian Boyle, who scored both goals. Boyle, the fourth-line center, scored only four times in 71 games last season. But he was given extra shifts because of the injuries to Gaborik and Drury, and he made the most of the opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s great to get into the rhythm of a game,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cTo get called on a few more times, that was a good feeling.\u201d Henrik Lundqvist also deserved credit for the point, stopping 34 of 38 shots from the Leafs, who are now 4-0 \u2014 their best start since 1993-94. The Rangers are 1-1-1. \u201cI\u2019m happy about our resiliency, getting a point after not doing what we needed to do through the first two periods,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the point.\u201d Brandon Dubinsky tried to dwell on the positive, saying, \u201cWe found a way to come back from two goals and create something positive.\u201d But the clouds cast a shadow over any positive developments. Particularly troubling was the second period, when the Rangers were overwhelmed and surrendered three unanswered goals. \u201cThey were screaming through the neutral zone,\u201d Tortorella said of the Leafs. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t catch them. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re that quick.\u201d Clarke MacArthur, Mike Komisarek and Phil Kessel scored for Toronto, all on plays that involved rushes down ice with Rangers chasing in futility. The Rangers also lost Gaborik and Drury in the second period. But their rally in the third tied the score thanks to Boyle and Sean Avery, who had about as mixed a game as any player can have. He had two assists, including the setup on the Boyle goal that tied the score, and went plus-3. Avery also took two needless penalties \u2014 one in which he dropped his gloves to fight Armstrong, who had not dropped his, and another in which he needlessly slashed Komisarek across the back of the legs during a stoppage in play. \u201cSean gave us some effective minutes,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cBut that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to have to continue working with him. He has to realize there are different ways to accomplish that.\u201d Boyle\u2019s goals, Lundqvist\u2019s saves and the Rangers\u2019 six penalty kills got them to overtime. But then the Rangers surrendered a seventh power play, after Marc Staal was penalized for interfering with Tim Brent. Kessel scored his second goal of the game on the ensuing advantage, 3 minutes 8 seconds into the overtime session. Tortorella said he was frustrated by Staal\u2019s taking an unnecessary penalty. Now the Rangers \u2014 who have managed to avoid injury trouble the last two seasons \u2014 must figure out how to plug the holes opened by the loss of Gaborik and Drury. Erik Christensen, recovered from a groin pull, should be ready to take Drury\u2019s place at center. Todd White may dress to take another vacant forward position, or the Rangers may try to call up Tim Kennedy, recently demoted to Hartford in the American Hockey League. But they could easily lose him to waivers, as he carries only a $275,000 cap hit for any claiming team.

{"title": "The Role of Politics in Wealth Distribution", "headline": "Mitt Romney\u2019s depiction of 47 percent of America as wealth takers touched on some unsettling facts about politics and wealth distribution.", "abstract": "MITT ROMNEY has apologized for his depiction of 47 percent of America as wealth takers rather than wealth makers. But his blunder touched inadvertently on some discomforting truths about the importance of politics in income distribution in the United States. If Mr. Romney\u2019s points were to be reformulated in a more defensible direction, the outline might look something like this: OF MAKING AND TAKING The correct distinction is not \u201cmakers versus takers.\u201d The problem is that taking, rather than making wealth, appears to be growing in relative influence. Most of us are actually both makers and takers. Consider farmers who produce food and favor agricultural subsidies. The question is whether the role of wealth maker has more influence over our politics, at any given time, than does the taker role. Is public policy being adjudicated on grounds of ethics and efficiency, or is the real story about lobbying and the relative power of different interest groups? It isn\u2019t easy to measure whether politics is less public-spirited these days, and we should resist the tendency to idealize the past. Still, job creation, median income and other measures of economic well-being have done poorly since the late 1990s. That suggests that America isn\u2019t paying enough attention to creating wealth and increasing general prosperity. FOLLOW THE MONEY Seven of the 10 most affluent counties in the nation are near Washington, D.C. That means a growing number of educated people are making a very good living advising, lobbying and otherwise influencing the federal government. This is a talent drain. It\u2019s far from obvious that we are getting better policy as a result, and true wealth creation has not kept pace. As Matthew Yglesias, a columnist for the online magazine Slate, has pointed out, there is also a subtler point about those wealthy Virginia and Maryland counties. They have high per capita incomes, not only because they attract educated, government-oriented professionals, but also because their zoning and building codes limit the supply of low-cost housing. That\u2019s a significant government intervention that hurts lower-income people, who must pay more. Privilege-seeking through government is often most pernicious when it has a tidy front and a well-manicured green lawn. UNEQUAL INFLUENCE Politics based on lobbying stacks the deck against lower-income groups, who are often outmaneuvered. For instance, one of the biggest problems faced by the poor today is inadequate K-12 education. They need improved public schools, more school choice, or some mix of both. Over time, such improvements would help deal with many other social and economic issues, including global competitiveness, domestic unemployment, public health and the budget deficit, because quality education has many beneficial effects. Instead, the current system of transfers offers to the poor various sops in place of more effective reforms. Fundamental improvements to education would involve more challenging changes to residential zoning, teacher unions and certification systems, and might also take some educational finance and control out of the hands of local municipalities. It is no surprise that well-off families want to keep a system that has done very well by them, and that the poor often lose political battles over education. EVERYONE FEELS ENTITLED People tend to think that they have justice on their side, whether it comes to making or taking. For example, millions of homeowners have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the premise that the tax deduction for mortgages will be continued. If they support a continuation of that deduction they hardly feel like brigands, even though a bipartisan consensus of economists doubts the efficiency of this tax break. As years and decades pass, recipients of this deduction and other benefits start to see them as deeply and richly deserved. Furthermore, almost all of us reap one or more of these benefits, so few individuals are consistently opposed to all government transfers. It becomes difficult for a politician to articulate exactly what is wrong with this arrangement when the audience itself is in on the game and perhaps does not want to hear about its own takings. A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The Founding Fathers were extremely worried about the threat to society posed by corruption and privilege-seeking. Drawing on examples going back to antiquity, they understood how unmitigated wealth-taking could create a negative and cumulatively self-reinforcing political dynamic. They also understood that the Constitution \u2014 or any constitution \u2014 would be an extremely imperfect remedy for this problem. \u0095 It is therefore correct to reject Mr. Romney\u2019s depiction as off-base and misleading. Yet the fact that he didn\u2019t present the truth is an indication that the problem is actually worse than many of us realize.", "keyword": [["United States Economy"], ["Romney Mitt"], ["Income Inequality"], ["Presidential Election of 2012"], ["Lobbying and Lobbyists"], ["High Net Worth Individuals"], ["Poverty"], ["Washington (DC)"]], "file_name": "the-role-of-politics-in-wealth-distribution", "date": "2012/10/14", "categories": ["business"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/business/the-role-of-politics-in-wealth-distribution.html", "author": "Tyler Cowen", "id": "0118528"}
{"title": "Timofey Mozgov of the Knicks Helps Russia at Worlds", "headline": "The story of Timofey Mozgov, who signed with the Knicks in July, belies that of a typical player in Russia, which tends to usher top young players to pro teams and coddle them.", "abstract": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 An international scout for the last 15 years, Kevin Wilson said that no matter how politically incorrect it is, he engages in profiling when analyzing European players. When scouting Russians, Wilson acknowledged, he casts a skeptical eye. Too often, he said, they have a poor work ethic and lack mental toughness. It is a stereotype that the Russian national team coach, David Blatt, said stemmed from a rule in the lucrative professional leagues there that requires teams to have two Russians on the floor at all times. But the back story of Timofey Mozgov, who signed with the Knicks in July , belies that of a typical player in the Russian system, which tends to usher top young players to pro teams and coddle them. Mozgov, 24, is an athletic 7-foot-1 late bloomer whose performance for Russia during pool play at the world championships has been one of the surprises of the tournament. Coming off the bench behind the former Kansas star Sasha Kaun, Mozgov scored 18 points in Russia\u2019s victory over Greece on Thursday, has averaged 11.8 points over all and has helped lead a Russian team without any N.B.A. players to a 4-1 record. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be easier for him in the N.B.A. than in Europe,\u201d Blatt said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to have to be a lead player, and they\u2019ll probably put him in a small area of the game where he has to pick and cut or run the break hard, which he does extremely well. \u201cStill, it\u2019s going to be a big adjustment for Timofey.\u201d If Russia beats France and the United States beats Angola in knockout-round games Monday, the teams will play Thursday . The game would give N.B.A. players their first significant look at Mozgov. Last week in Ankara, he looked like a polished passer in Blatt\u2019s hybrid Princeton offense and showed a soft touch on his jump shot. Tapping in putbacks against Ivory Coast is easier than boxing out his childhood idol, Kevin Garnett, but there are certain things that will not be lost in translation. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach what he has \u2014 body, size and athletic ability,\u201d said Tony Ronzone, the director of international player personnel for USA Basketball. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to find in the world.\u201d Mozgov said he was excited at the opportunity to come to the N.B.A. and described his only visit to New York as crazy. He said he planned on moving to New York with his girlfriend but did not know where he was going to live. Mozgov said he had been learning more English to help ease his adjustment, and at a recent interview he used an interpreter only about half the time. \u201cI will have to prove myself, and I will try and show the coach that I can play,\u201d he said. He added with a smile, \u201cBecause I want to play.\u201d How much Mozgov plays will depend on his adjustment on and off the floor. Wilson said Mozgov was \u201ckind of a maverick\u201d by Russian basketball standards. He started playing late, never signed with a powerhouse Russian club and avoided signing with a Russian agent. Having to fight to be noticed helped him forge his work ethic. Mozgov spent most of his childhood near Krasnodar, a small agricultural city about 100 miles from the Black Sea. His family moved there from St. Petersburg, he said, because his father had health problems. The youngest of four brothers, Mozgov grew up in a working-class family. He said his father worked as a driver for a private company and his mother stayed at home to raise the family. \u201cHis family is definitely blue collar,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s never had money, and he\u2019s not money conscious the way a lot of poor kids are. That\u2019s another thing that I like about him.\u201d It is common in Europe for top youth players to sign with pro teams at young ages. But Mozgov said he did not start playing basketball seriously until age 15 when he went to a boarding school in St. Petersburg at the suggestion of a local coach. \u201cI was playing only in my school, and it wasn\u2019t a school that prepared me for basketball,\u201d he said. That trip matured Mozgov\u2019s game and also helped him handle his older brother, who he said roughed him around while growing up. \u201cWhen I left and studied, and after my year I came back, my brothers couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said with a smile. Mozgov never signed with a powerhouse Russian team like Dynamo Moscow or CSKA Moscow. He also did not play a lot for his club team, B.C. Khimki. Blatt said that Mozgov did not play much more than 15 minutes a game last year and compared him to a young pilot needing flight time. \u201cHis adjustment will be bigger than most, but his upside is great,\u201d Blatt said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Timofey making the jump. It\u2019s not going to be easy for him. If he works hard and the New York people help him, he\u2019s got a good chance to do something.\u201d Part of Mozgov\u2019s value to the Knicks is as an athletic big man who can alleviate some of the pounding that Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, their prized free-agent signing , will take in the post. But to trade elbows with N.B.A. centers, Mozgov will need to continue to fill out his 269-pound frame. Because his most polished skill is his ability to use his athleticism to run the break, it is easy to see how he fits into Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s up-tempo system. From his limited time working out Mozgov and seeing him on tape, D\u2019Antoni said he was impressed with his ability to shoot the 15-footer, play pick-and-roll and run the floor. But he called Mozgov\u2019s hands average and cautioned that success in individual workouts and Europe did not always translate to the N.B.A. \u201cThis kid, I\u2019m excited about him; I want to see him play five on five,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cBut what we saw of him working out, we\u2019re excited. We think he can be really good.\u201d He added, \u201cHe can be a good bookend with Amar\u2019e. I do worry about his defense a little bit.\u201d Mozgov signed a three-year deal with the Knicks worth about $9 million, but his impact may not be felt immediately. A classic late bloomer, Mozgov will need time to mature in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s very raw, and he needs a lot of work,\u201d said Wilson, the Knicks\u2019 director of international scouting. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to him or anyone else to expect he\u2019s a superstar out of the gate. \u201cThe best thing is if he could progress from a 5-minute guy to a 15-minute guy. If he can warrant being on the floor from 15 to 18 minutes, I think that would be a great first season for him.\u201d", "keyword": [["Basketball"], ["Mozgov Timofey"], ["New York Knicks"]], "file_name": "05basketball", "date": "2010/09/05", "categories": ["sports", "basketball"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/sports/basketball/05basketball.html", "author": "Pete Thamel", "id": "0229743"}
{"title": "Craig Spencer, New York Doctor With Ebola, Will Leave Bellevue Hospital", "headline": "Dr. Spencer, who had contracted the virus while treating patients with the disease in Guinea, is now free of the virus, hospital officials said.", "abstract": "Craig Spencer, the New York City doctor who became the first person in the city to test positive for Ebola, is free of the virus and is set to be released from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday, hospital officials said on Monday. Dr. Spencer, 33, who had been in Guinea treating Ebola patients with Doctors Without Borders, was rushed to Bellevue by ambulance on Oct. 23 after reporting a fever of 100.3 to the authorities that morning. He was placed in isolation in a secure ward, and within hours a blood test confirmed he had the virus. His infection set the city on edge and set off a race to find his contacts over the previous few days, when he went bowling , dined out and rode on the subway and in an Uber taxi. But to date, no one else in the city has tested positive for the virus. Dr. Spencer is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at the hospital. Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, said in a statement that \u201cafter a rigorous course of treatment and testing,\u201d Dr. Spencer posed \u201cno public health risk.\u201d It was unclear on Monday whether Dr. Spencer would return to his Hamilton Heights apartment, where his fianc\u00e9e, Morgan Dixon , is under quarantine. Two friends who had contact with him in the days before his diagnosis were initially held in quarantine, but were recently released. Dr. Spencer was given a range of treatments, including an experimental drug and blood plasma donated by a recovered Ebola patient, Nancy Writebol , a 59-year-old missionary who contracted the virus in Liberia. His condition was serious at first, but by last week, he had recovered enough that he asked for, and was given, his banjo and an exercise bicycle to pass the time while he was in isolation. Dr. Spencer\u2019s recovery adds to the evidence that when treated in advanced American hospitals, Ebola has a far lower fatality rate than in West African field hospitals starved of doctors, nurses and equipment. While 70 percent of Ebola patients in Africa are dying, eight of the nine patients treated in the United States have survived. The only one who died was Thomas Eric Duncan , a Liberian, whose treatment was delayed when a Dallas hospital initially misdiagnosed his illness. The experience of the Dallas hospital \u2014 two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan there contracted Ebola, but survived \u2014 caused American hospitals and public health officials to re-examine how they responded to possible cases. Requirements for protective gear were revamped, and when Dr. Spencer was taken to Bellevue, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dispatched a team to New York even before tests confirmed he had the virus. In Dallas, the C.D.C. did not arrive until two days after it was called. A day after Dr. Spencer went to Bellevue, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that all travelers arriving in New York who had had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined for 21 days, even if they had no symptoms and thus were not likely to be contagious. That policy, which New Jersey and several other states also enacted, was criticized by some public health experts as an overreaction that would discourage doctors and nurses from traveling to Africa to help contain the virus. Mr. Cuomo said he preferred to err on the side of caution.", "keyword": [["Ebola"], ["Craig Spencer"], ["NYC"], ["Bellevue Hospital Center"]], "file_name": "craig-spencer-new-york-doctor-with-ebola-will-leave-bellevue-hospital", "date": "2014/11/11", "categories": ["nyregion"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-doctor-with-ebola-will-leave-bellevue-hospital.html", "author": "Anemona Hartocollis", "id": "0047160"}
{"title": "Bill Pascrell Defeats Steve Rothman in New Jersey", "headline": "In a bitter primary, Bill Pascrell defeated Steve Rothman, a fellow congressman and former friend who moved into Mr. Pascrell\u2019s district.", "abstract": "PATERSON, N.J. \u2014 In a hard-fought race that pitted two Democrats and onetime friends against each other, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. won the primary in the Ninth Congressional District on Tuesday. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Pascrell had 64 percent of the vote, beating Representative Steve Rothman, with 36 percent, according to The Associated Press. The Ninth District, in northern New Jersey, is one of a handful of newly shaped Congressional districts across the country with Democrats facing each other because of election maps redrawn after the 2010 census. The race was exceptional in that one of the candidates, Mr. Rothman, moved in order to challenge a fellow Democrat. And not just any Democrat, but one with whom he had shared dinners and commutes to Washington over 16 years together in Congress. A result was the kind of bitter campaign usually seen between two parties, with negative advertising, furious accusations of betrayal and voter suppression, and visits from prominent surrogates. Mr. Pascrell had a rally on Friday with former President Bill Clinton. And Mr. Rothman, the first in New Jersey\u2019s delegation to endorse Barack Obama in 2008, campaigned with the president\u2019s chief political adviser, David Axelrod. Taking the gymnasium stage to the theme song from \u201cRocky\u201d at Passaic County Community College, Mr. Pascrell, 75, began simply, \u201cWe did it!\u201d and then theatrically rolled up the sleeves of his white dress shirt. \u201cMy parents always told me not to start fights, but to know how to end them,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, we did just that.\u201d In the nearby 10th District, which includes Newark, Donald M. Payne Jr. won a six-way race for the seat left open by the death of his father in March. His closest contenders were Nia Gill, a state senator who asked voters to make her the only woman in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation, and Ron Rice Jr., who serves on the Newark Municipal Council, of which Mr. Payne is president. In November, Mr. Pascrell will face the winner of the Republican primary on Tuesday, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, the author of \u201cKosher Sex\u201d and a memoir of his time as spiritual adviser to Michael Jackson. Rabbi Boteach won a three-way race. But the district heavily favors the Democrat in the general election, and the party\u2019s primary had become the state\u2019s most closely watched campaign. Mr. Pascrell\u2019s victory was a triumph of assiduous retail politicking and an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort, particularly in his hometown, Paterson, the state\u2019s third largest city. The demographics of the newly configured district favored Mr. Rothman. Just over half its residents had been in the district he represented before the lines were redrawn. In Bergen County, where most voters in the reshaped Ninth District live, Mr. Rothman had the so-called line, the party blessing that translates into a favorable ballot position, with his name alongside President Obama\u2019s as the official Democratic candidate. But analysts warned all along against counting out Mr. Pascrell and his love for a street fight. His campaign pinned its hopes on increasing turnout in Paterson, a largely poor, immigrant city where he had been mayor. The campaign said it had registered 10,000 new Democrats there. That strategy appeared to have worked, with campaign operatives reporting high turnout in the city and relatively low turnout in Englewood, where Mr. Rothman was once mayor. The two men, both elected to Congress in 1996, began their battle after New Jersey\u2019s redistricting commission, faced with eliminating one of the state\u2019s 13 districts, moved Mr. Rothman\u2019s home in Fair Lawn into the Fifth District, which has slightly favored Republicans. It is now represented by Scott Garrett, who is almost invariably labeled \u201ca Tea Party darling\u201d in local papers and blog posts. Mr. Pascrell, who has extensive political connections in the state \u2014 his former chief of staff was on the redistricting commission \u2014 was given the Ninth, a heavily Democratic district. Rather than run against Mr. Garrett, Mr. Rothman, 59, opted to move and run against Mr. Pascrell. This caused consternation for New Jersey Democrats who thought both men had served the state well in Congress, and for national Democrats, who were trying to win 25 House seats needed to retake the majority. The party\u2019s Congressional leaders beseeched Mr. Rothman to challenge Mr. Garrett instead of one of his own, arguing that even if he lost, he would be a hero to the party should he decide to run for the United States Senate, as he has said he would like to. Mr. Pascrell relentlessly accused Mr. Rothman of being too weak to take on the real fight, against a conservative Republican. Mr. Rothman argued that much of the Ninth District included his former constituents \u2014 even if his house and district offices were in the Fifth. He argued he was \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 Democrat,\u201d trying to paint Mr. Pascrell as aligned with Republicans on health care, abortion and taxes. But the two largest newspapers in the district, The Star-Ledger of Newark and The Record of Hackensack, both endorsed Mr. Pascrell. They criticized Mr. Rothman for fighting against a fellow Democrat rather than a Republican, and for running misleading ads that edited footage to suggest Mr. Pascrell had supported Republican positions on taxes.", "keyword": [["Pascrell William J Jr"], ["Rothman Steve"], ["Elections"], ["House of Representatives"], ["New Jersey"], ["Garrett E Scott"], ["Redistricting and Reapportionment"]], "file_name": "bill-pascrell-defeats-steve-rothman-in-new-jersey", "date": "2012/06/06", "categories": ["nyregion"], "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/nyregion/bill-pascrell-defeats-steve-rothman-in-new-jersey.html", "author": "Kate Zernike", "id": "0129811"}

The activist, Jiang Tianyong, is a disbarred lawyer who has energetically supported the families of human rights lawyers caught in a crackdown that began in July 2015. Mr. Jiang\u2019s family and friends lost contact with him on Nov. 21. The website of The Legal Daily, an official newspaper, said on Friday that the police detained Mr. Jiang when he tried to travel to Beijing by train from Changsha, a city in southern China. They accused him of using a fake identity card to buy a ticket. After he was in custody, much graver charges were lodged: Citing the police, the newspaper said Mr. Jiang \u201cillegally possessed multiple secret state documents, colluded with overseas institutions, organizations and individuals, and is suspected of illegally providing state secrets abroad.\u201d It appears likely that Mr. Jiang, 45, will join a long list of Chinese rights advocates who have been detained, discredited and in some cases imprisoned as a warning to others not to embrace dissent. About 250 lawyers and activists were detained in the crackdown last year. Most were released, but about 17 were arrested and in some cases tried and imprisoned on subversion and other charges, according to estimates by Amnesty International. The Legal Daily said Mr. Jiang was a \u201ccitizen advocate\u201d who \u201cmeddled in some serious cases, wantonly fabricated and spread rumors on the internet, and incited petitioners and the families of people in legal proceedings to resist state agencies.\u201d Patrick Poon, who researches Chinese issues for Amnesty International from Hong Kong, said in an interview that \u201cwithout access to a lawyer of his own choice, Jiang Tianyong is at risk of torture or other ill treatment.\u201d The Chinese news reports said Mr. Jiang had been held under \u201ccriminal coercive measures\u201d since Dec. 1.

The reports said the police had notified Mr. Jiang\u2019s family about his case. \u201cThat\u2019s simply a lie,\u201d Mr. Poon said.
